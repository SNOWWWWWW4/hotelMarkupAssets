-Peer Review comment:  Nov 3 Time 3:31-  your website is 60% imo to the prototype , the headerimg is to big needs to be smaller, the awards need to be aligned properly. Amenities background needs to be smaller and also you need to add an img below reserve a room. Your website is almost responsive. Good job liam.
